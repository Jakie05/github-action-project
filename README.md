Spring Boot Application CI/CD Pipeline
This repository demonstrates a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Spring Boot application. The pipeline is set up to automatically build, test, and deploy the application to Docker Hub when changes are pushed to the repository.

Overview
Spring Boot: A popular Java framework for building web applications.
CI/CD Workflow
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (ci-cd.yml) that automates the CI/CD pipeline. The workflow consists of the following stages:

Build: The Spring Boot application is built using Gradle or Maven.

Test: Unit tests are executed to ensure the application's correctness.

Dockerize: The application is packaged into a Docker container.

Deploy to Docker Hub: The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, making it available for deployment.

Getting Started
To set up your own CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

Clone this Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

Create a Spring Boot Application: Create your Spring Boot application in the repository or replace the existing one.

GitHub Repository Setup:

Create a new repository on GitHub.
Push your Spring Boot application code to the new repository.
Docker Hub Setup:

Create an account on Docker Hub if you don't have one.
Create a repository on Docker Hub where your Docker image will be hosted.
GitHub Secrets:

In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings" > "Secrets."
Add the following secrets:
DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username.
DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password or personal access token.
DOCKER_REPO: The name of your Docker Hub repository.
GitHub Actions Workflow:

Edit the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file in your repository to configure the workflow according to your project structure.
Commit and Push: Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically trigger.

Workflow Customization
You can customize the CI/CD workflow by modifying the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file. This file defines the steps and actions that GitHub Actions will perform during the pipeline.
