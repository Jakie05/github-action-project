# Spring Boot Application CI/CD Pipeline

This repository demonstrates a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Spring Boot application. The pipeline is set up to automatically build, test, and deploy the application to Docker Hub when changes are pushed to the repository.

## Overview

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): A popular Java framework for building web applications.

## CI/CD Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`ci-cd.yml`) that automates the CI/CD pipeline. The workflow consists of the following stages:

1. **Build**: The Spring Boot application is built using Maven.

2. **Test**: Unit tests are executed to ensure the application's correctness.

3. **Dockerize**: The application is packaged into a Docker container.

4. **Deploy to Docker Hub**: The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, making it available for deployment.

## Getting Started

To set up your own CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Create a Spring Boot Application**: Create your Spring Boot application in the repository or replace the existing one.

3. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Push your Spring Boot application code to the new repository.

4. **Docker Hub Setup**:
   - Create an account on Docker Hub if you don't have one.
   - Create a repository on Docker Hub where your Docker image will be hosted.

5. **GitHub Secrets**:
   - In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings" > "Secrets."
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
     - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or personal access token.
     - `DOCKER_REPO`: The name of your Docker Hub repository.

6. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Edit the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file in your repository to configure the workflow according to your project structure.

7. **Commit and Push**: Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically trigger.

## Workflow Customization

You can customize the CI/CD workflow by modifying the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file. This file defines the steps and actions that GitHub Actions will perform during the pipeline.
